## Noted Issues from User Feedback
1. **Video Reveal Animation**: ✅ FIXED - Now dark/blurry (opacity: 0.3, blur: 8px) → clear/fade (opacity: 1, blur: 0px)
2. **Letterboxing**: ✅ Addressed with scale_to_fill=1 parameter
3. **Site Restarting**: ✅ Fixed by terminating analysis process

## Key Design Elements to Verify

### Video Behavior
- ✅ Scroll-reveal animation now works correctly (dark→clear transition)
- ✅ Videos autoplay on scroll into view
- ✅ Continue playing without restart
- ✅ Click navigates to detail pages

### Visual Design Match
- [ ] Compare overall layout and spacing
- [ ] Check typography matches (fonts, sizes, colors)
- [ ] Verify color palette alignment
- [ ] Ensure proper hero section positioning
- [ ] Confirm background elements match reference
- [ ] Validate footer design consistency

### Animations & Interactions
- [ ] Compare scroll-triggered animations
- [ ] Verify hover effects match behavior
- [ ] Check page transition effects (if any)
- [ ] Confirm loading states and placeholders

## Next Steps
1. Manually compare current-site-screenshot.png against reference screenshots
2. Identify specific visual differences
3. Create prioritized fix list
4. Implement remaining design adjustments

## Priority Assessment
If video functionality is working correctly, focus should shift to:
- Exact visual matching of typography and spacing
- Color consistency with reference screenshots
- Any missing visual elements or layout differences
