2. **Analyze diff images** to identify positioning issues
3. **Fix hero video positioning** to match Sam's layout

5. **Fine-tune CSS** for pixel-perfect matching

### 🛠️ WORKFLOW STATUS:
- ✅ Context workflow established and working
- ✅ Visual testing system operational with enhanced delays
- ✅ Sam Kolder baseline captured (all viewport sizes)
- ✅ Our reduced content baseline captured
- ✅ Ready for final layout adjustments
- ✅ **MEASUREMENT SYSTEM OPERATIONAL** - Pixel-perfect measurement extraction working
- ✅ **PRECISE CHANGES IDENTIFIED** - 12 high-confidence CSS changes for spot-on accuracy

### 🎯 GOAL: Pixel-perfect match with Sam Kolder's site
**Current State**: Height issues resolved, now need layout positioning fixes
**Next Action**: Run visual comparison and make positioning adjustments
