  changes: [
    "Changed font-size from 1.6rem to 1.2rem (structural approach)",
    "Changed font-weight from 100 to 50 (structural approach)",

  results: [

    "Previous incremental size changes (1.6rem, 1.8rem, 2.0rem, etc.)",
    "Complex gradient backgrounds for showreel",
    "Lower z-index values (1000, 1001, etc.)",

    "Continue with structural approach for remaining issues",
