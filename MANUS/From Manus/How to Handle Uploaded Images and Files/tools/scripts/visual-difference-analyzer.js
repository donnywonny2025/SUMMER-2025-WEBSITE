üéØ VISUAL DIFFERENCE ANALYZER
=============================

üìã VISUAL ANALYSIS CHECKLIST:
=============================

üîç LOOK AT THE SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISON AND ANSWER:

1. TEXT POSITIONING:
   ‚ñ° Is our text in the same relative position as Sam's?
   ‚ñ° Does our text appear too high/low compared to Sam's?
   ‚ñ° Is our text too far left/right compared to Sam's?

2. VIDEO POSITIONING:
   ‚ñ° Is our video in the same relative position as Sam's?
   ‚ñ° Does our video appear too high/low compared to Sam's?
   ‚ñ° Is our video too far left/right compared to Sam's?

3. SHOWREEL POSITIONING:
   ‚ñ° Is our showreel in the same relative position as Sam's?
   ‚ñ° Does our showreel appear in the right area of the video?
   ‚ñ° Is our showreel the right size compared to Sam's?

4. OVERALL LAYOUT:
   ‚ñ° Does the overall composition look similar?
   ‚ñ° Are the proportions similar?
   ‚ñ° Does the spacing look similar?

5. MOST OBVIOUS DIFFERENCES:
   ‚ñ° What is the most obvious thing that looks wrong?
   ‚ñ° What should be fixed first?
   ‚ñ° What would make the biggest visual improvement?

üéØ ACTION PLAN:
===============
Based on what you can see, identify the top 3 most obvious problems
and fix them one by one, taking screenshots after each fix.

üí° FOCUS ON VISUAL DIFFERENCES, NOT MEASUREMENTS!
