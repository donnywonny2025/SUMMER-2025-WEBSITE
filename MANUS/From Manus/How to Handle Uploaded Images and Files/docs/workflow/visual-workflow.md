# Visual Verification Workflow

## Problem Solved âœ…
- **Issue**: Screenshot commands were hanging due to multiple Chrome/dev server instances
- **Solution**: Created bulletproof screenshot system with proper cleanup and timeouts

## Reliable Visual Verification System

### 1. Clean Setup
```bash
# Kill any existing processes
pkill -f "vite|npm|chrome|chromium"

# Start clean dev server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Take Screenshots
```bash
# Use bulletproof system (no hanging)
node bulletproof-screenshot.js
```

### 3. Visual Comparison
```bash
# See what screenshots we have
node visual-summary.js

# Analyze changes
node visual-comparison.js
```

## Available Screenshots
- **Our Site**: `bulletproof-*.png` (fresh screenshots)
- **Sam Kolder**: `tests/screenshots/baseline/sam/*.png` (reference)
- **Test System**: `tests/screenshots/current/our_site_*.png` (automated)

## Workflow Rules
1. **Always clean up processes** before taking screenshots
2. **Use bulletproof system** for reliable screenshots
3. **Verify changes visually** after each design modification
4. **Compare with Sam Kolder** as the Holy Grail reference
5. **Update context files** immediately when issues are identified

## Success Criteria
- Screenshots complete without hanging
- Visual changes are actually visible
- Design quality matches Sam Kolder's aesthetic
- Height differences minimized across viewports

## Next Steps
1. Use bulletproof system to verify current design
2. Compare with Sam Kolder's screenshots
3. Identify specific improvements needed
4. Make targeted changes and verify with new screenshots
