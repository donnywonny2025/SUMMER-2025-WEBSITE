# Visual Discrepancy Analysis

Based on a thorough review of the last screenshot and the target design, I've identified the following discrepancies:

- **Heading Font:** The font size in the current version is excessively large, and its weight is much bolder than the lighter, more refined font in the reference image.
- **Line Spacing:** The line spacing (leading) between the lines of the heading does not match the more compact spacing in the target design.
- **Missing Showreel Element:** The circular "SHOWREEL" video player element, a prominent feature in the reference image, is completely absent from the current implementation.
- **Incorrect Footer:** The footer containing "Cape Town, SA / World" and the email address is visible at the bottom of the page. In the reference image, the hero section is full-screen, and this footer is not present.

To resolve these issues, I will:

1.  **Correct the CSS** for the heading to adjust the `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `line-height`.
2.  **Add the showreel video element** to the `App.jsx` file, ensuring it is positioned correctly.
3.  **Remove the footer** from the main view of the `App.jsx` file to create the full-screen hero effect.
